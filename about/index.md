Tamago Gamer is a blog about gaming focusing on the pocket and comfy side of it. It's about gaming the coolest, most comfortable and unique way possible. Oftentimes, we spend more time creating our gaming setup or researching about its possibilities than actually playing.

We're all about handhelds, including retro ones and new ones. We love the Nintendo Game Boy, the Nintendo DS and 3DS, and the Nintendo Switch. We also love mobile devices and how we can use game pads and have emulators to play on the go. We love the new chinese or home-made handhelds that can surpass any other mainstream consoles ever made.

Tamago Gamer is about playing the comfiest way possible! This site is run by Milla Slot, pen name @hypermilla. I am a digital designer by formation and web enthusiast. My day job is as an indie game developer and studio owner, and in the meantime I like to read and write about, collect and play with gaming handhelds. I am especially in love with the Nintendo 3DS, the console that got me back into console gaming after a long time, and am perpetually affectionated by the Game Boy Color and Pok√©mon, the gaming duo that changed my life.
