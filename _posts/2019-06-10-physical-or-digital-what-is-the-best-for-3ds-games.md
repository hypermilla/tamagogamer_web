<p>Unlike other game consoles, there is a huge difference in buying physical or digital Nintendo 3DS games. This was determined by Nintendo's policies and infrastructure established back when the system was first released, and that has been kept until now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of that, the Nintendo 3DS has a history of making it hard for fans to decide whether to buy physical or digital games. Nintendo finally changed that paradigm with the Switch, since the new console makes it easy to sync your content to a new console. All you have to do is login with your Nintendo Account on a different Switch and, if you want, you can make it your "primary" device and download all your games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Nintendo 3DS, though, all the content you bought digitally on the eShop is not only linked to your account, but it's also tied to your device.  This means that, if you lose your device, break it, or it gets stolen, you lose all your digital games. Nintendo support can help you recover them, though that's not guaranteed and will for sure bring a lot of stress.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it raises the question: Physical or Digital? There are certainly ups and downs to each one and, in my opinion, the best is a combination of the two.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Buying Physical Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical games are the favorite for those who like collecting. The best thing about physical games is owning the cartridge and the box. 3DS cartridges are small and cool, and some of the boxes are amazing. Also, some of them came with special items like AR cards and accessories. The best thing is when you have a lot of them and can physically see your collection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of that, you can play your physical games on any compatible 3DS console, any time you want. With digital games, if you want to play on a different device, you need to perform a system transfer. That not only takes a while (especially if you have lots of games) but it also can only be done once every 7 days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is even better if you own a couple of different 3DS models. I know, not all of us are like that! But the 3DS has so many different versions, with so many cool designs. If you do, having your games physically means you can switch between devices freely, and experiment to see in which one you think they play the best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some games you might prefer a bigger screen like the XL, while for some you're better off with a smaller and more portable device. Or, what I think is more common: you might want to play a few games with 3D. I'm personally a big fan of the New Nintendo 2DS XL, and I like to carry it around more than the others. But I really miss the 3D, so when I buy a new game that I would really like to check out in 3D, I would rather get it physically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buying physical also gives you the option to buy used (pre-owned) games, which may come for cheap. Sometimes you would rather buy a pre-owned physical, pay a bit less and keep the box than buy digital. Also, a lot of the cool games on the 3DS massive library are the Nintendo DS games, which are only available physically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other side is also true: one of the greatest advantages of physical games (and one that game platforms would love to exterminate) is the ability to sell your used games. If you buy a boxed game, you can just sell it and get some of your money back once you're done with it.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Buying Digital Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest advantage of digital is very simple: you get your games instantly and you can take them anywhere, without worrying about carrying cartridges. You can change games on the fly, with just a few button presses. Some games are better for having around all the time than others, so you might want to consider having a few of them digital even if physical is your thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other games, on the other hand, are ONLY available in digital form. While there are a few retail-only games (Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is a great example), there are many games on the 3DS that are only available on the eShop. These include most indie games, which usually don't see retail releases, but also all the Virtual Console games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another great advantage of digital is something most people are very sensible about: digital sales. Buying games digitally means you can enjoy the occasional sales on the eShop. Now that the system has been around for many many years we don't know how many sales we're still gonna get. But up until now, the 3DS eShop has offered some very good sales, and the Nintendo Switch is even better on that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buying digital games also means you can enjoy your My Nintendo points to get discounts. If you have your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS on the same Nintendo account, this is even better. Any purchase you make on one of them gives you more gold coins to buy new games.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: A Combination of the two</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned, for a lot of games we don't have the option: we can only either get them physically or digitally. If you want to be a collector and have an amazing library of boxes to show for it, then just buy everything you can physically. But for most people and for most games, we can choose, and then we have the option to choose wisely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get the games you want to take with you all the time in digital form, and buy the ones you'd like to experiment with on a few different devices, or the ones you think your friends would like to borrow, or maybe you think you might want to sell, in physical. Keep in mind also specifics of each game, like trading in Pok√©mon or AR cards in Kid Icarus: Uprising.</p>
