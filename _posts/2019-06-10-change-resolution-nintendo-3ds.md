<p>One of the best things about the 3DS is its amazing catalog of games. Not only it has access to its own extensive library but also has backward compatibility with all of the DS and DSiWare library, which are massive, and Virtual Console games from a bunch of different other systems, like the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Super Nintendo (SNES), etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the games from the DS and the Virtual Console (VC) come from older consoles, and all of them had different screen resolutions than the 3DS. That brings a new problem when playing those games on the 3DS screen: they are, by default, not displayed in their original resolution. That may make the games look weird for those used to their original pixel/aspect ratio.</p>

<h3>Changing the game resolution on the Nintendo 3DS</h3>

<p>Nintendo has offered us a solution from the start. There are two modes for playing DS, DSiWare and Virtual Console games on the 3DS. By default, they are displayed with an altered resolution, made to better fit the 3DS screen.  But if you hold <strong>Start</strong> or <strong>Select</strong> while booting the game, it displays the game in its native resolution.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For trained eyes and long-time fans, this original resolution produces a much sharper picture, since it has the game's original size in pixels and aspect ratio.</p>

<p>Cool fact: for most Virtual Console systems, Nintendo created a cool border that looks like the original console. So, if you play a Game Boy Color game and press Start or Select during boot, you see the game in its native resolution, and with a GBC border around your game.</p>

<h3>Changing resolutions on Nintendo handhelds is not new to the 3DS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's interesting that Nintendo kept a tradition of allowing players to change the resolution of legacy games on their systems. The Game Boy Advance played Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, and it had the L and R buttons, which were not available in the previous systems. So, using the L/R, players could toggle between native resolution and stretched image. Cool, right?! Props to Nintendo for that.</p>

<h3>One more interesting bonus fact: Changing Brightness on DS games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One other cool thing a lot of people don't know is that you can also change the Screen Brightness of DS games by pressing Home, then holding Start, and then pressing UP or DOWN on the D-pad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not really necessary anymore as the 3DS has its own Brightness settings in the system's menu.  But, if you played enough DS games on your 3DS, you know that, after you start a DS game, you can't go back to the home screen without closing the game.  So, if you're playing a DS game on your 3DS, you cannot change the screen brightness through the system menu after you start the game. You'd have to close it and then open again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original Nintendo DS did not support multitasking, and you could not go back to the home screen without closing the current application. So, to change screen brightness on the DS, this is how you do it: through a combination of buttons. And we can still do it now, with the 3DS.</p>
