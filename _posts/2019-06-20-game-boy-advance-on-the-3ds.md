<p>To this day, there is no official <strong>Game Boy Advance Virtual Console</strong> on the <strong>Nintendo 3DS eShop</strong>, which is a huge disappointment to many fans.  When Nintendo released the 10 GBA games exclusive to their Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program back in 2011, many hoped it would be the first step for a wide number of GBA titles to get over to the 3DS. That, however, never happened, and no other GBA game ever touched the 3DS.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A while later, Nintendo released the <strong>Game Boy Advance Virtual Console</strong> on the <strong>Wii U</strong> instead, and it's possible they wanted those games to be exclusive to the Wii U, since the system needed more sales and more content.  But there are many other aspects to it, and the real explanation might just be a technical one.</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Game Boy Advance Virtual Console and Other Games on the Nintendo 3DS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Game Boy Advance games released for the Ambassador Program miss a lot of the features that any other Nintendo 3DS games have, making it a very different experience to play. Here are some of the differences:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Save Data</strong> is handled differently and stored in a different place.</li><li>There is no <strong>Sleep Mode</strong>: When you close your 3DS, the game keeps running all the same. This is the same behaviour the Nintendo DS or DS Lite had when playing GBA games.</li><li>They can't be run in the background. Whenever you're in the game and press the Home button, you're asked to close the game and warned about losing your progress.</li><li>The normal Virtual Console features are not available, like <strong>Restore Points</strong> and <strong>Reset</strong> button.</li><li>The <strong>3DS Wi-Fi</strong> doesn't work.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is actually happening under the hood is that these games are not running inside the Virtual Console, like the other NES, Game Boy, SNES or any other VC title. Instead, they are running natively on the 3DS, as if it were an actual Game Boy Advance.  That's why features we take for granted, like Sleep Mode or running in the background, don't work at all. The Game Boy Advance did not have a Sleep function, and neither did the Nintendo DS when playing GBA game paks.</p>

<h2>How does the Nintendo 3DS play Game Boy Advance games natively?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To understand how the Nintendo 3DS plays Game Boy Advance games, we have to the 3DS architecture. The device has two different processors (CPUs): its main, one called ARM11, and a smaller one, called ARM9, which is called the "Nintendo DS Chip". When the system plays a GBA game from the Ambassador Program, its boots into a kind of DS Mode, where the ARM9 slows down (running at a slower speed, the same speed the original GBA hardware did) and plays the game natively.  Basically, the 3DS acts as if it was a super GBA, and plays the game as the original GBA would, with the same hardware constraints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That also means that the native features of the 3DS don't work in that mode. While the ARM11, the main 3DS CPU, is still active and working, it's working in a different mode and is only controlling inputs and rendering video. That's what's causing normal native features of the 3DS like Wi-Fi, Sleep Mode, and running apps in the background, not to work.</p>

<h2>Why were Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games never released on the Nintendo 3DS?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lack of native Nintendo 3DS normal features makes the experience of playing games like this not really at the same level of quality and usability as everything else on the system. That probably is the reason Nintendo decided to not release other titles that way. After all, it's very hard to explain to users why they can't put a specific game on Sleep Mode â€” that just seems like a malfunction, and is a big user experience problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering these reasons, it's understandable Nintendo would not be satisfied with the quality of the Game Boy Advance Virtual Console. On top of that, it would probably require some extra work to release GBA games in a different way. While another way never happened for the 3DS, it happened for the Wii U, and we hope they make it happen for the Nintendo Switch too.</p>

<h2>Other ways you can you play Game Boy Advance on the 3DS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the modding community has created other ways for players to have GBA games on their 3DS. These methods require some modification on the Nintendo 3DS, including a few exploits, unlocking or adding Custom Firmware to your device. But if you don't mind that, there's a lot of ways to play other games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's possible to inject GBA ROMs in the same Virtual Console used for the Ambassador games, running natively and without any problems. But there are also a few Game Boy Advance emulators that work on the 3DS. This proves the Nintendo 3DS hardware is capable of emulating GBA games, other than just simulating it (running like native).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually simulating games as if they were running on native hardware (like the Game Boy Advance VC does) is considered much more efficient emulation. Since the game is running natively, it guarantees that most games will work just fine, without the need for special adjustments. Emulation, on the other hand, means there is a software trying to re-create the conditions for that game to work as it did on the original hardware. Playing like this can have some problems, and sometimes specific features on specific games require extra adjustments to work. It's common to experience sound issues with frequency or bitrate, or having problems with specific parts of the game, when running emulators.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you want to play Game Boy Advance games on your 3DS, you have three options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Get an Ambassador 3DS and enjoy the 10 Classic Games Nintendo made available;</li><li>Add Custom Firmware to your 3DS and do VC Injection to play ROMs natively;</li><li>Add Custom Firmware or other exploits on your 3DS and download Emulators to it.</li></ul>
