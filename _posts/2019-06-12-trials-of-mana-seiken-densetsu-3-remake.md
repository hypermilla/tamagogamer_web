<p>Seiken Densetsu 3, or Secret of Mana 2, as it might have been called if it ever got released on the West, is one of my favorite games of all time. The game was released in Japan back in 1995, and was announced in the West as the sequel to the critically-acclaimed Secret of Mana, but the localization never happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're like me and grew up scouring the internet for JRPGs information, looking for Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance ROMs and the likes, then you might have stumbled upon a "Secret of Mana 2" ROM at some point.  Turns out, that was a pretty popular game around the 2000s, when ROMs and emulators got really really popular, and this was considered a JRPG and SNES classic. But what everyone in this side of the world played wasn't the original release: it was a fan-made translation of a japanese-only game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2000, the english translation project led by Neill Corlett, <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Neill+Corlett">who is actually quite known</a> in the emulation community for that and a few other projects, was completed and distributed to fans as a patch  available for the game's ROM.  It was first available on his website (which is not online anymore, unfortunately), but you could of course just download the translated rom with the patch already made, as most people did. But the translation, which was a super sophisticated hack at the time, got extremely popular, presented the game to many many players around the globe, and spawned translations in many other languages like French, German and Spanish.</p>

<h3>So, how did this amazing game never get released outside of Japan?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 1995, during the game's development, Seiken Densetsu 3 became known in North America as Secret of Mana 2, and had its released planned for the end of that year. It was a huge hit in Japan, and magazines were already starting to write about it in North America.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the release never happened, and over the years fans got some theories about why. The most famous rumor is that another RPG game, Secret of Evermore, was being developed at the time, and that Squaresoft (as Square Enix was called back then) decided to release it instead of Seiken Densetsu 3. The fans have since carried ill feelings against Secret of Evermore, made bigger still by the similarities both in name and in the mechanics in both titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the <a href="https://mana.fandom.com/wiki/Seiken_Densetsu_3">basis for the rumor</a> is that a new development team was set up at Squaresoft's office in Redmond, Washington, to develop Secret of Evermore, and that would have taken away resources from the japanese translation.  The rumor was then debunked by a developer from Secret of Evermore, who said the development team was created solely for that game and had no implications whatsoever on the translations of Seiken Densetsu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, one more accepted reason (as was cited by Nintendo Power, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_of_Mana#Development">acccording to WikiPedia</a>) is that the probability of a North American release for Seiken Densetsu 3 was low due to technical issues, and it would have been too costly to produce. Basically, it's said that the game had some bugs that would have made it very hard to be localized, and especially certified for released by Nintendo of America without a LOT of work.</p>

<h3>More than 20 years later, we're finally getting an official release</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's probably a sound reason, but it's a shame the game has been kept from us for so long, especially being a part of such a successful franchise. In years following Seiken Densetsu's release, sequels to the Mana series were introduced for other consoles like Playstation One, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, and were all released in the West. Now, in recent years, Square Enix has even created remakes of the first installments of the series and released them on a couple different platforms, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.secret&amp;hl=en">especially mobile.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in June 2017, Seiken Densetsu 3 was finally touched again, as the game was released for the Nintendo Switch as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection, along with ports of the original Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana (respectively Seiken Densetsu 1 and 2 in Japan) only available on the Japanese eShop. Then, 2 years later, in June 2019, we finally get our Collection of Mana in western eShops. For the first time we have Seiken Densetsu 3 in english officially, and renamed to "Trials of Mana".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most amazing part of this announcement for me is not even finally getting the localization. After all, there seems to have been fewer and fewer japanese-only releases lately, both for Nintendo and Sony, and releasing a collection of a highly-acclaimed JRPG franchise only in Japan sounds a bit weird with all the success we're seeing from RPGs on the Switch. Of course, translating and licensing Seiken Densetsu 3 in the West would surely have been a problem, but one that would most likely be commercially viable with the Collection's sales on the console.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most amazing part, then, is the announcement of the full remake of Seiken Densetsu 3. Now THAT was unexpected! And even better, it got a much nicer tratment than the latest Seiken Densetsu remake that came out for mobile and Steam, which didn't look so good. The new Trials of Mana looks astonishing, and brings to life classic beloved characters as I had honestly never even imagined.  The combat has been reimagined for modern standards, keeping the action real-time combat and expanding it so it looks like a promising modern action RPG.</p>

<p>Take a look at the new trailer released during Nintendo's E3 Direct.</p>

<h3>But what makes this old JRPG so special?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking forward to playing the remake, or even buying the collection, new players might be wondering what is so good about Seiken Densetsu 3 that would make it worth it.  It's true that a lot of players prefer the original Secret of Mana over this one, but for me there is no question, it's Seiken Densetsu 3 all the way.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Seiken Densetsu 3 has a unique formula of playable characters and storyline. When you first start the game, it asks you to just choose 3 characters out of 6 displayed on a screen. Without saying more, the game is making you choose not only your party, but also the order you're meeting each character. The first one you select is going to be the story's protagonist and ultimately the "Hero of Mana" (as seen in other Mana games), and the other two will be introduced later, in the order they were chosen.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each character has a different story and comes from a different region. The beginning of the game is very different depending on who you choose, making it worth it to see the start of the game from all perspectives. All the regions are important to the story though, so every player's experience is different: if I start with Lise, I'm gonna see the Wind Kingdom of Rolante (I wonder if they kept the same names?! They're probably not even the same in the new version!) first in the game. If I start with Angela, I'm gonna see this location only later on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The characters are also divided in pairs, and each of pair follows a similar storyline, opposing a the same threat throughout the game. Even though the main story is similar accross all characters, with more or less the same things happening, there are 3 possible villains (the "final Boss"), each with their own motivations, dialogues, fight, etc. The villain changes depending on which character you choose. Also, if you have the pair from your character in your party, there are special dialogues to be seen. Actually, I believe the dialogues are always different depending on which characters you have in your group, and combining different ones makes it one of the most fun parts of this game.</p>

<h3>Light or Dark? Building your character and your team</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Combining" is a very important word in this game, not just in the characters themselves. There are also classes to be attained, and builds to be made. Each character can change classes twice during special player-induced moments the game, with a total of 4 different final classes in the to choose from.  Changing classes requires some leveling and being at the right place, so it's something you might have to prepare to, and even study about a little bit.  Also, most importantly: once you do a class change, there is no turning back. So you have to be careful - oldschool RPG style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time you change classes with a character, you choose between "Light" or "Dark" - thinking about it now, that is something that might change names with the new translation too. The class combinations used to be called as "Light-Light", "Light-Dark" or  even "Dark-Light". Basically, you can choose between Light and Dark twice, ending up with a total of 4 combinations for each character. The sprite of the character changes, along with the skills he/she learns. There are some comboes to be made and teams to be built, which makes it a fun replayable experience!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seiken Densetsu also has some "Pokémon-like" elements, with types that are weak or strong against each other. I remember I made a team once with Lise being a Star Lancer, which could turn all enemies into a certain type. Then I had Hawk become a Ninja Master, which turned my team's weapons into a certain type. That was good times! Super effective all the way with some set up.</p>

<h3>An amazing combination of great Art, Narrative, Music, and solid Gameplay</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pixel art present in this game is, to this day, impressive. Its assets have been used as inspiration in many games. The classic style of the Mana series is distinguishable from afar, and this one is no exception. I can see the Mana Tree for a few frames or some color scheme and think of this game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The music is also no exception, and has been my companion for many hours. Here, take a freebie and listen to this airship theme, as you fly with Flammie over the map:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But overall, what made Seiken Densetsu special was that it had a pretty unique JRPG formula. First, it was a full real-time action RPG, which was not the norm at the time. Most games were turn-based, like Chrono Trigger, and some had some interesting real-time mechanic, like Tales of Phantasia, but Seiken Densetsu (both 2 and 3 for the SNES) presented combat in a much more dynamic way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Combine that with the possibility of having six different characters and playing with the three of them in your party. Now imagine seeing them running around and attacking and being able to control them. On top of that, consider you can build them with different classes and play with different strategies.  Oh, and you could play coop too! You could do 2-player coop on the Super Nintendo and have two people control different characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, as the cherry on the top of this amazing JRPG mix, come the intertwining stories. What made this game special for me is that you met every character and all of them had some part in the story, being in your party or not. Every time you play changes, and your choices count. The game gives you reason to care about the story, and to see it again and again.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's something I'm looking for in RPGs nowadays, as much as I was back in the 2000s.  Now I'm eager to get to my Switch and try out the game in its official version for the first time. I wonder which character I'm gonna pick.  </p>
