<p>An <strong>Ambassador 3DS </strong>is a Nintendo 3DS device who has access to a few exclusive games, only available to certain players who bought the 3DS on its very first years. The group of exclusive games included <strong>10 NES titles and 10 Game Boy Advance titles</strong>. The NES titles were later made available on the eShop, but the <strong>Game Boy Advance</strong> kept being exclusive to those <strong>Ambassador 3DS </strong>owners, <strong>making this kind of 3DS very special for collectors.</strong></p>

<h1>What is the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program?</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program</strong> is a special feature created by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. It was a program Nintendo made to reward players who were early adopters and bought the original 3DS before the price was cut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The<strong> Nintendo 3DS</strong> was originally released in n February 26, 2011 in Japan, March 25, 2011 for Europe, March 27, 2011 in America and March 31, 2011 in Australia. In August 12, 2011, its price was officially dropped from USD $249.99 to $169.99 in America, and similarly worldwide.</p>

<h2>How could you become an Ambassador?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Ambassador Certificate</strong> was given to all players who had logged on to the Nintendo eShop on their 3DS before August 12th, after they updated their console.  A few players reported they were able to get access to the games later even if they had never logged into the eShop with their devices, by contacting Nintendo Support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than granting access to download the special 20 games, players could download the<strong> Ambassador Certificate</strong> as a software on their 3DS, with a notification features. When turned On, it allowed the player to receive notifications exclusive to Ambassadors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the only way to get an Ambassador 3DS is to buy a pre-owned one from someone who had access to it and activated it.</p>

<h2>What games are included in the Ambassador Program?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were 20 games included in the program. First, 10 NES games were made available, and after December 16, 2011, the 10 Game boy Advance games were released.</p>

<h3>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These games were first released as exclusive to the Ambassador Program, but later were released on the <strong>Nintendo eShop</strong> with the release of the <strong>NES Virtual Console</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 10 <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Virtual Console </strong>games available in the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Super Mario Bros.</em></li><li><em>Metroid</em></li><li><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></li><li><em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em></li><li><em>Balloon Fight</em></li><li><em>Ice Climber</em></li><li><em>NES Open Tournament Golf</em></li><li><em>Donkey Kong Jr.</em></li><li><em>Yoshi</em></li><li><em>Wrecking Crew</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Game Boy Advance (GBA) Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These 10 exclusive games are, to this day, the only way legitimate to play Game Boy Advance games on the Nintendo 3DS.  Until now, Nintendo has still never released an official GBA Virtual Console or re-released any of its games, other than full remakes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These games weren't made perfect, though: <strong>they lack any kind of Sleep feature or Restore Point feature</strong>, usually included in Virtual Console titles. They are natively loaded, which means they run on the console as if you were playing a GBA cartridge on an original Nintendo DS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ten&nbsp;<strong>GameBoy Advance</strong> <strong>games</strong> available in the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>F-Zero Maximum Velocity</em></li><li><em>Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</em></li><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</em></li><li><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</em></li><li><em>Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em></li><li><em>Mario vs Donkey Kong</em></li><li><em>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</em></li><li><em>Metroid Fusion</em></li><li><em>Wario Land 4</em></li></ul>

<h2>What makes the Ambassador Program special nowadays?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owning an <strong>Ambassador Nintendo 3DS</strong> is a very exclusive thing, available only to a handful of people nowadays. As time passes, they become increasingly rare and more valuable. The <strong>Ambassador Certificate</strong> is a piece of <strong>Nintendo 3DS</strong> history, and owning one comes with some bragging rights. Other than that, the one thing people look for in owning an Ambassador 3DS is having <strong>access to the exclusive Game Boy Advance games.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selection of GBA titles is very good, containing 5 games from the <strong>Mario</strong> series, one <strong>Zelda</strong>, one <strong>Kirby</strong>, a classic <strong>Metroid</strong> game, and two <strong>Wario</strong>-themed titles, which are not something you see in a lot of consoles. But most importantly, <strong>these 10 titles are still the only way to play Game Boy Advance games on your Nintendo 3DS</strong>, if you don't want to hack it in any way or add Custom Firmware.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While many fans hoped those first 10 games were the beginning of a wide number of GBA titles getting to the 3DS, that never happened, and the only console to get GBA Virtual Console until now was the <strong>Nintendo Wii U</strong>. I explained the most likely reasons why the 3DS never got anymore GBA games <a href="https://tamagogamer.com/game-boy-advance-on-the-3ds/">in this other post (including some deep technical explanations about the Nintendo 3DS CPU)</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you want to play a very cool collection of GBA games that would not be available in any other way, or if you want to own a piece of 3DS history that only a few people will be able to own, it's definetely worth getting an Ambassador 3DS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you're still not a Game Boy Advance fan, these games are probably enough to make you one. Here are a few reasons that make those games worthwhile:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</strong> is a Zelda title developed by <strong>CAPCOM</strong>, and not Nintendo, and has one of the most iconic pixel art of all time, celebrated by enthusiasts;</li><li><strong>Metroid Fusion</strong> was the last 2D side scrolling Metroid to be released, until Samus Returns launched for the 3DS in September 15, 2017;</li><li><strong>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</strong> was the first of a long series of WarioWare games, and it's still one of the most enjoyable;</li><li><strong>Wario Land 4</strong> is one of the most celebrated titles in the Wario Land series, which only had one more entry after this one, Wario Land: Shake it!, for the Wii, which was very different and a big departure in many ways, making this one a classic.</li></ul>
