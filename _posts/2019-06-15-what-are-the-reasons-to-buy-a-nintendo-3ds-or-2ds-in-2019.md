<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->I'm not gonna lie, the Nintendo 3DS might be my favorite console of all time. It's the successor to the DS line, which is the spirit successor to the Game Boy Advance line. And that's a LOT! I still have high hopes that the Switch will inherit those characteristics and become their spiritual successor in the future, but I have my doubts, and I personally hope Nintendo puts out a new line of handhelds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->But while that doesn't happen, everyone is talking about the Nintendo Switch. And with all the reason to be! It's an amazing system, extremely innovative, with access to third-party support like the Nintendo from a few years ago would never dream of. And on top of that, they've been killing it with the new releases.</p>

<h2>But then, why would you buy a 3DS in 2019 (or beyond)?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->What does the Nintendo Switch miss that the 3DS has, or what does it have that is different and worth giving a try?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Portability</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->First of all, its Portability. The Switch may be portable, but it's not as portable as a Game Boy of old or as a DS or 3DS. The hybried console doesn't fit in someone's pocket or in a small purse. Also, it's fragile. The clamshell design of the 3DS makes it possible for someone to just throw the device on a backpack and not worry at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->Well of course there's probably gonna be scratches, and you might want to protect your device still. But with the Nintendo Switch it's basically unadvisable to carry it around without a case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Amazing Library</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->The 3DS has the most amazing library of all time, I believe. I have written before about how you can play Pok√©mon games from every generation on the console, and every Legend of Zelda game up until the Game Cube generation and lots beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->Other than that, there are thousands of 3DS original games, and then thousands of Nintendo DS games to be played. Some of them can be found pretty cheap pre-owned, and most of the better known ones will be available on the eShop for quite a few years still.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->The New 2DS XL, the Nintendo 3DS' most recent revisions, sells for half the price of the Nintendo Switch. On top of that, the price for a first-party game on the 3DS it $40 USD instead of $60.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->If you want to be even cheaper, you could get a 2DS with a game included for about $90 usd. I would say any 2DS bundle is actually an amazing deal. This device doesnt have 3D but plays basically every 3DS game (apart from very few "New 3DS" exclusive ones), is very comfortable to hold and play, and it's super durable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Retro gaming</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->The Nintendo 3DS is still a system that is on sale and easy to find at stores, with games still selling physically and, better yet, digitally. Also, being still an active system, it has nice sales frequently, and you can also still get rewards from My Nintendo with your purchases on the 3DS eShop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->That being said, out of all "Retro" gaming devices you could get, the 3DS is the only that offers the advantages of an active non-retro one. If you take into account the ability to easily do custom firmware (for those who are into it), then you can play even more retro games with it, and dozens of emulators.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->The Nintendo 3DS still is and will continue forever to be an amazing system, both for retro lovers, nintendo enthusiasts, and video games fans in general. No time will take away its amazing library. But still today, as it is still active, it's a very worthy gaming device to take around and buy new games to try. The Nintendo Switch is, for the good or the bad, still not a substitute to the DS line, and so we will continue to enjoy it for a long time.</p>
