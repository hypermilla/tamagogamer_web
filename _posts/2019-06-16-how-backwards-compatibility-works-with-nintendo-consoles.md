<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> has a long history of supporting backwards compatibility with their portable systems. Since the <strong>Game Boy</strong> was first updated to the <strong>Game Boy Pocket</strong> up until the <strong>3DS</strong> and <strong>2DS</strong> were released, every revision or new generation of Nintendo portable consoles have <strong>kept some kind of backwards compatibility.</strong> There are a few exceptions where a revision lost a few features, but overall that has been true and a great addition, increasing tremendously the available library for all these systems.</p>

<h2>What is Backwards Compatibility?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Backwards compatibility is the term used in the video games industry to indicate a device or console is able to reproduce games from a previous generation. Not having backwards compatibility means a console is not able to play games from its previous generation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The topic became a heated debate during the release of the current generation of consoles, especially for the <strong>Playstation 4 </strong>and <strong>Xbox One,</strong> which did not have backwards compatibility. The <strong>Xbox One</strong> worked a few ways around it over time, adding support for a few games from the<strong> Xbox 360</strong>. The next generation of consoles, the so-called <strong>Playstation 5 </strong>and <strong>Xbox's Project Scarlet</strong>, are said to include backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>If you played the <strong>Game Boy Advance</strong> or the <strong>Nintendo DS </strong>when they came out, or if you were a kid back then, then you probably remember a sight like this: someone playing a video game with a cartridge sticking out. That happened with the GBA with a <strong>Game Boy</strong> game inserted, or in the Nintendo DS and DS Lite, with a GBA game card inserted.  Nintendo fixed that later with the 3DS, making the cartridge almost exactly the same size as the DS. </p>

<h2>Nintendo's History of Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to Nintendo, the company has a history of keeping backwards compatibility in their handheld line, and for a long time also had in their home console line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first Nintendo consoles did not have backwards compatibility, meaning the <strong>GameCube</strong> can not play <strong>Nintendo 64</strong> games; the<strong> Nintendo 64</strong> can not play<strong> Super Nintendo</strong> games, and the <strong>Super Nintendo</strong> can not play <strong>NES </strong>games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nintendo's console line supported backwards compatibility with the release of the<strong> Nintendo Wii</strong>, which could play <strong>GameCube</strong> games. The <strong>Wii U </strong>was then still able to play<strong> Wii </strong>games. But then that line was broken with the release of the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, which does not have backwards compatibility.  A lot of the most popular <strong>Wii U </strong>titles were ported (adapted and re-released) to the<strong> Nintendo Switch</strong>, a lot of times with added content in "<strong>Deluxe</strong>" versions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> also marks a move to a much more digital-focused distribution by Nintendo. With more and more games being available digitally, supporting previous generations games could get a lot easier, since the hardware doesn't have to support the physical media from the original console.</p>

<h2>History of Backwards Compatibility with Nintendo Handhelds</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to their portable devices, Nintendo has a long history of keeping them backwards compatible. Up until now, all generations of portable devices by Nintendo have supported their previous ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Game Boy games were supported in the Game Boy Color; both of them were supported by the Game Boy Advance; Game Boy Advance games were supported by the Nintendo DS (up to the DS Lite); and Nintendo DS games are supported by the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opposite is not true. Even if Nintendo portable devices share a similar name, like Game Boy or DS, you can not play games from a newer device on an older one. The Nintendo DS doesn't play Nintendo 3DS games, for example. But the Nintendo 3DS plays all DS games.</p>

<h2>What will happen after the 3DS?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now Nintendo is supporting the system, and it still sells. It's also a quite differentiated product from the Nintendo Switch, and targets a different audience. But if Nintendo chooses to go forward with only one line of products (Console + Handheld in one hybrid, instead of separate), that would mean the end of a long line of backwards compatible hardware.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, I am here hoping for a Nintendo Switch revision that is smaller in size, has clam-shell design, and plays DS and 3DS games. One can always dream.</p>
