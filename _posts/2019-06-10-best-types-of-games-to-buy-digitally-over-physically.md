<p>In many cases, choosing whether to buy a game physically or digitally can be a hassle. Especially when we're dealing with handheld consoles, like the Nintendo Switch, or the <a href="https://tamagogamer.com/physical-or-digital-what-is-the-best-for-3ds-games/">Nintendo 3DS, which has some peculiarities of its own</a>. Maybe you're a collector, or you have few storage space on your device's SD card, or you just like having a collection of game boxes. Because I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out, <strong>I came up witch a strategy </strong>to help me decide which games are better off as a digital copy, and which ones I would rather have a physical version to add to my collection.</p>

<h2>How to choose which games you should buy the digital version?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose the ones<strong> you'd like to play over many different sessions</strong>. This way, you can be sure whenever you have your console with you, you can play those games. Even if you have case to carry cartridges, chances are your collection will eventually get too big to carry around.</p>

<h3>1) Multiplayer Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The games that fit this condition the best are usually multiplayer games, like <strong>Mario Kart</strong>, <strong>Mario Party</strong>, <strong>Splatoon</strong>, etc. This type of game is great to have around when you meet your friends, so it's great to have them constantly available on your device.  That's usually one of my rules of thumb for buying Nintendo Switch or other handheld games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of the Nintendo 3DS, the multiplayer side is still true (especially for Mario Kart or Smash Bros, if you have friends to play with), but usually you'll be playing by yourself. And in that case, there are many games you'd like to have with you all the time. </p>

<h3>2) Games to Play in Short Bursts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another great fit to have digitally are games you like play in short bursts, and/or games you're constantly trying to beat high scores. Games that fit this description nicely are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Racing or other High Score game like Mario Kart (once again);</li><li>Rhythm games, like Taiko no Tatsujin, Hatsune Miku's Project Mirai or Project Diva, Rhythm Heaven Megamix, etc;</li><li>Puzzle games like Lumines, Tetris, or Sushi Striker; </li><li>Collections of mini games like WarioWare Gold or Mario Party. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are great to have in digital form, so you can play for short amounts of time over many, many sessions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3) Games you know you will be playing for very long</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is also another very special case: games you know you will be playing for years. The games that fit that description the best are RPGs or Adventure games you will be working constantly over a bigger goal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the Nintendo Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a great example of a game like that. It's a game you would like to play in short bursts, but also during long hours. And the amount of content in the game is so huge, you can be playing for months or years if you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another example that fits this category very well are Pokémon games. Pokémon games are very valuable to have in digital form. Having your Pokémon collection digitally means you can have the games anywhere you want, and it's something you might be playing for many years. On your Nintendo 3DS you can even change between lots of Pokémon games (<a href="https://tamagogamer.com/pokemon-generations-nintendo-3ds/">the system lets you play Pokémon games of all generations until 2019</a>), and you can send your mons to <strong>Pokémon Bank</strong> and then go back. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it must be said that having all your Pokémon games digitally in the same device limits your ability to trade between the games. So, if you're that hardcore, you might want to consider having two accounts, or even better, having one copy digital and another physical. For example, you could have<strong> Pokémon X</strong> digital with your main game, and a physical copy of <strong>Pokémon Y </strong>(buy it pre-owned) that you can wipe as much as you want to search for legendaries, shiny Pokémon, or just trade the mons you need.</p>

<p>For all the other types of games, you will be fine buying physically.</p>

<h3>What types of games should you buy physically?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Single-player campaigns and games you will probably play once and be done with after a while. These games often have pretty interesting box arts, which makes them great additions to your physical collection.  Some of them  have special editions that are also worth checking out, if you're a big fan, or just like artwork and extras. One other great advantage is that you can borrow the game to a friend or even sell it after you're finished with it, something you cannot do if you buy digital. </p>
