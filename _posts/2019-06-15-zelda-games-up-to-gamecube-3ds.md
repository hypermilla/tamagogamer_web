<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->Did you know? You can play basically every Legend of Zelda game up to the Nintendo GameCube on your 3DS. That's a lot of Zelda games, and here we're gonna outline all the Legend of Zelda games available on the Nintendo 3DS, officially.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->More than anything, one of the most amazing things about the Nintendo 3DS is its crazy extensive library. I already outlined how <a href="http://tamagogamer.com/you-can-play-pokemon-games-of-every-generation-on-your-3ds/">you can play Pokémon games from every generation on the 3DS</a>, and now I want to tell you about all the Zelda games you can experience on the system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->Taking into account the retail games released for the 3DS, the Virtual Console games, the Nintendo DS and DSiWare titles available thanks to backwards compatibility, you can play basically every Legend of Zelda game up to the Nintendo GameCube your 3DS. How? Let's take a look!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Legend of Zelda games in order of release</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Legend of Zelda</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->The first Zelda game ever developed. A classic that created an amazing franchise and a new genre of adventure games. This is also the one that was the inspiration behind Breath of the Wild: the sense of exploration and adventure present in the first game was sought after by the developers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Nintendo Entertainment System (1986).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Virtual Console (2012)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Zelda II: Adventure of Link</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->The only ever 2D side-scrolling zelda. Long-time fans long for the day when Nintendo will decide to remake this game. It's a very different Zelda game and - in my opinion - a very hard one. It's a great fit if you want to try something very different or if you're just curious about video game history!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Nintendo Entertainment System (1988)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Virtual Console (2012)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->One of the most beloved Zelda titles of all time. This title established many core concepts in the series. Also re-released on the Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Super Nintendo (1991)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available Exclusively on the New Nintendo 3DS:</strong> SNES Virtual Console (2013)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->A Legend of Zelda classic that was the first to come out for a handheld, and also set the standards for games of the franchise on portable devices. A remake of this game is expected to released for the Nintendo Switch in August 2019.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Game Boy (1993), DX version for the Game Boy Color (1998)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Virtual Console (2011)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->The first installment in the series with full 3D graphics, and a classic that set new standards for Video Games during its time. Ocarina of Time was released for the 3DS as a remake with enhanced graphics, bugfixes and extra content from the Master Quest edition, that was released first for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. The 3DS version was later added to the Nintendo Selects collection, sold for half the original price.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Nintendo 64 (1998)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the New Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Physical release or Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->Seen as kind of a sequel to the Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask is a macabre and unique Zelda title, with a theme very different from the other games. It was released on the Nintendo 3DS as a remake just like Ocarina of Time, and also added to the Nintendo Selects collection.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Nintendo 64 (2000)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the New Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Physical release or Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->The pair of games were released simultaneously for the Game Boy Color in a style similar to the Pokémon games: two versions of the same game with some original content. They had a pretty cool feature: if you finish one of the games, a special password will appear ("Secret to Holodrum" in Oracle of Ages, "Secret to Labrynna" in Oracle of Seasons), which can be used in the opposite game when creating a new file, creating a new "Linked Game" that continues the plot.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Available on the New Nintendo 3DS:</strong> Virtual Console (2013)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->An iconic Legend of Zelda title developed by Capcom, with a classic pixel art that is remembered very fondly by fans. It is unfortunately only available for owners of an Ambassador 3DS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><strong>Original release:</strong> Game Boy Advance (2004)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Beyond the GameCube Era</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->From this point on, we enter the GameCube era. As we've seen, ALL the Zelda games released up to this point are ALL available in the Nintendo 3DS. Pretty impressive, huh?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->And we still haven't even talked about the Zelda games that came out for the Nintendo 3DS itself, or even Nintendo DS, which share backwards compatibility with the system and are perfect to play on. Playing DS games in non-DS consoles can be a pain, due to the lack of the dual screen and touch screen functionalities, so the 3DS really shines in this regard.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->The following are the Nintendo DS and 3DS titles that came after:</p>
